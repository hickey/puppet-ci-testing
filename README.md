# Repository is deprecated

This codebase has been moved to https://gitlab.com/wt0f/puppet-ci-testing/

The files that are currently here are from the `0.15.0` release and will receive no further updates. Please visit the GitLab repository for the latest updates and documentation.

## Why was the repository moved?

Testing of the code was originally done through TravisCI, but since it is no longer a free service.... The GitLab CI environment is much more complete and the plan is to include full end to end testing and deployment to rubygems.org.
